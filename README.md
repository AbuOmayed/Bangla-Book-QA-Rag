# Bangla-Book-QA-Rag
Bangla Book QA RAG is a multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions in both Bangla and English from a Bangla literature textbook (HSC26 Bangla 1st Paper). It retrieves relevant information from a pre-processed PDF knowledge base and generates context-grounded responses.
